Her mother wanted her to not follow her tracks and kept her as virgin. One day when her mother was very ill, a man fooled Dhanam by saying that he will take her to the hospital so that they can bring the doctor home, but raped her on the way. She began to have sex for money to save her sick mother, but unfortunately her mother died some days later. Since Dhanam was too young and she did not have anyone to take care of her, she began with prostitution and settled down in Gandhi Theru.

During her pregnancy Vedhagiri tries to make a deal with Dhanam, but she refuses again. This begins to happen often. Dhanam keeps this secretly from her husband and in-laws because they have a lot of respect for him. Dhanam later gives birth to a baby girl. After the birth, the family begins to go through a hard time. They ask Vedhagiri to check the horoscope and find out why this happens. Vedhagiri says that the time the baby was born was not good. He says that the baby has to die or everyone in the family will die within a year. The family keep this secret for Dhanam and kill the baby by feed it with poison. Some days after the death of her child, Dhanam finds out that her in-laws were behind of the murder. Dhanam who saw her daughter as her mother, becomes stressed and Grieves over her dead baby.

One day, after a court hearing, goons attack Velu Prabhakaran, and he is rushed to the hospital in a serious condition. The police investigates the attempted murder, and a female journalist (Stefi) who has recently interviewed Velu Prabhakaran is interrogated by the police. A few days ago, Velu Prabhakaran told her the story of his film who was about three women - Raani (Shirley Das), Thangam (Preity Rangayani). and Saroja (Babilona) - who hailed from the village Vishnupuram. The three women have one common problem: lust. Vishnupuram is affected by the communal riots that frequently break out between upper-caste people and lower-caste people. During a riot, the lower-caste girl Raani is saved by the upper-caste boy named Sakthi (Jai Rathan), and they then fall in love with each other. Sakthi is the son of the heartless caste leader Reddiar, while Raani is the niece of the brute Karuppaiah (Sampath Ram). Reddiar and Karuppaiah are archenemies. A bachelor school teacher (Adhiroopan) falls under the spell of his maid Thangam, a poor single mother. Thangam was dumped by her boyfriend after she was pregnant by him; therefore, Thangam was rejected by her brother Pazhani and sister-in-law Saroja. One day, the teacher gives Thangam a glass of milk mixed with sleeping pills and rapes her. He promises to marry Thangam but later announces to her that his family arranged his wedding with a woman of his caste. Feeling betrayed by a man for the second time, Thangam spits on his face, and he leaves the village. Saroja, who would do anything for money, has an affair with Reddiar. One day, Pazhani caught Saroja sleeping with Reddiar, and Reddiar brutally kills him. After telling the story, Velu Prabhakaran shared with the journalist his troubled love life and the reason which prompted to direct this film. Back to the present, the police arrest the culprit: Velu Prabhakaran's ex-wife, who wanted to hide her previous marriage from her new husband, hired goons to kill him. A few months later, Velu Prabhakaran, now healed, meets the journalist and tells her the climax of his film. The young lovers decided to elope, but Reddiar catches the young lovers and beheads Raani. In turn, his son Sakthi murders him. The journalist then proposes her love to Velu Prabhakaran. He tells her that he does not believe in love, but he believes in lust.</div>"

However, Pandi's mother Sivagami (Saranya Ponvannan) showers all her love and affection on him. His mother has a dream of building her own house in her land. Rajapandi asks Pandi to go to a marriage ceremony. While on the train, he met Bhuvana (Sneha), a cop's daughter in the other village, and after a sequence of events, romance blossoms between them. One afternoon, Bhuvana gives all the money she has on her person to Pandi and convinces him to take her out to lunch at a restaurant. After eating his lunch, he went outside to wash his hands and saw his sister and her boyfriend having a conversation. Pandi chases the motorbike on an auto, leaving Bhuvana stuck with the bill and no money, having given it all to Pandi. When Pandi eventually catches up with the boyfriend, the boyfriend tells him that they are seriously in love, and he is going to be coming over to their place with his parents to ask for her hand in marriage. Everything was going well until a couple days later, Sundarapandi wanted the money to buy the jewelry. Pandi's family receives a shock as Sivagami cannot find the money that they have saved up to pay for the wedding. Since Pandi is already a known troublemaker and has been to jail already, Sundarapandi blames Pandi and kicks him out of the house. This happens in front of Bhuvana, who has come to see where he has been the last few days and why he ran away at the restaurant. This incident with Sundarapandi accusing Pandi of taking the money has convinced her that he took her money the other day and ran and also just using her. In the end, it turns out that Rajapandi has run away from the house with his lover and with the money. Sundarapandi is consoled by Pandi, who borrows money from a private money lender and completes the wedding. Meanwhile, Pandi tries to make amends with Bhuvana, but she will not hear any of it. Sundarapandi, seeing the argument, went over and told Bhuvana the truth and how he misjudged his son and that is was not him that took the money. The following day, Sundarapandi went to Bhuvana's house to ask her father Periyamaayan (Ilavarasu) to fix a marriage between Pandi and Bhuvana. Periyamaayan, upon hearing this, gets furious. He is the local police inspector and knows all about Pandi's past. He refuses to marry his daughter to a criminal. Periyamaayan arranges a marriage for Bhuvana, but she went to Sundarapandi to say that she will die before marrying another person than Pandi. Pandi snatched Bhuvana from her house, takes her to the police station, and asks her father to approve of their marriage. Periyamaayan gets angry and says that Bhuvana is not his daughter anymore and that he will think his daughter eloped and lost. Pandi marries Bhuvana and as police protection, Periyamaayan watches her getting married. Determined to pay back the loan and help his family overcome their financial constraint, Pandi decides to go abroad and work as a conservancy staff.

Prakash (Prakash Raj) the only son of a billionaire industrialist and Priya (Abhirami) an Ooty-based tea estate heiress board a train to Delhi as strangers, in the Chennai central station. They get seats next to each other and introduce themselves to one another. As a coincidence, they get to know that all 3 of them have passed the UPSC exams with high ranks, and are going to Delhi for phase-4 of their Civil Service training and become friends. During the course of the training, Surya loves Priya, whereas Prakash lusts after her. While Surya's dad Manivannan and Priya's family visit the trio in Agra, Prakash reveals to Priya's mom about his desire to marry Priya. At the same time, Surya's dad asks Surya to marry Priya. During the last days of training, Priya also falls in love with Surya. During the results of Phase 4, Priya gets selected as cadre-I IAS officer, while Prakash misses the cut-off and becomes Cadre-II IPS officer, because he had spent 2 minutes of the final exam thinking about Priya. At the same time, Surya's results are held back by the UPSC board, because of an FIR in Surya's name. 3 years earlier, Surya was a village farmer. During harvest, the local tasildar refused to pay the farmer's demand and started to forcefully take their cane crop to government stores at a cheaper price. Surya protested against this, and he hits the tasildar as the tasildar hit his father. Surya is arrested and placed in police custody. The villages continue their protest at the police station, prompting the District Collector Lakshmi IAS to come to the station the next day. She studies the situation, and causes the government to pass a GO in favor of the farmer's demands. While she asks the police to release Surya after knowing that he is a post-graduate, they refuse, as an FIR has been filed on him, and Surya must be presented before a magistrate. Shocked by this development, the Collector, in her right as District Magistrate cancels the FIR and lets Surya go free. This power of an IAS officer led to Surya taking up the UPSC exams. After Surya's explanation, UPSC agrees to let him go, but holds his result pending an inquiry. Surya and Priya then visit Lakshmi IAS, who is now deputy-Home secretary in Chennai, asking her help. After that they propose to one another, and start their one-month vacation. Surya refuses to go to his village, as he had promised that he will return only as an IAS officer. So he visits Priya's family in Ooty. Priya's mom and sister happily accept Surya as prospective groom for Priya. After a month, Priya leaves for her job as Assistant Collector in Chennai. While all goes well, it is revealed that months ago, a rich newspaper owner son Arun has tries to harass Priya's sister Pavithra during her way to school and Pavi had him imprisoned for that. Arun, in an act of vengeance, blocks Pavi's public exam number in all newspapers on the result day. Due to power failure, no news of results reaches Priya on the correct time, and Priya's mother assumes that she has failed her exam due to playfulness. Hurt, Pavi commits suicide. During her funeral, news agencies come to reveal that Pavi had come as first rank in the state. Adhi and his friend also come to the funeral. Adhi's friend reveals Adhi's misdeeds to the public and Surya pushes Adhi against a tree, in a fit of rage. Adhi gets a head injury and dies. Surya is arrested on murder charges and sent to Chennai prison for remand. At the same time, Prakash joins as an IPS officer, and begins his duty in Chennai Jail. It is revealed that Prakash is to serve for 24 hours to fulfill his father's wishes and then resign to enjoy his life as a billionaire. At the same time, Surya is brought to Prakash's jail. Prakash is initially shocked at Surya's state, but decided to use it to his advantage. He cancels his resignation plans and makes multiple attempts as Surya's life through the inmates. He also asks Surya to convince Priya to marry him. Surya agrees, and Prakash takes him out on Parole to meet Priya. There, Surya reveals that he knows that Prakash informed the UPSC about his FIR incident, and Surya will not give up Priya. This makes Prakash even angrier. Days later, Prakash receives telegram that Surya's dad is dead, but he refuses to let Surya go for the funeral. Surya is aided by a constable Alex, and he escapes via a tunnel. It turns out that Alex is on the payroll of Prakash. Within minutes of Surya's escape, Alex is killed by Prakash, and he frames Surya for that murder. He conspires with Arun's father to publish headlines that Surya has been shot dead for the murder of Alex. Surya is received by an impostor at the end of the tunnel, and realises the folly. Surya comes back to the jail by daybreak, beats Prakash black and blue, and reseals himself in his cell. The arriving officers realised Prakash's crimes and arrest him. The public outcry for Surya causes the high court to acquit him of the accidental murder, and thus Surya joins the State government as an IAS officer, and makes his dad proud. He also marries Priya.</div>"

In the meantime, due to many inauspicious incidents and endless obstacles hitting the family's peaceful life, Gomathi's family conducts a Kavidi prashnam under the supervision of their family astrologer. In the Kavidi prashnam, it is suggested that the only way to end their bad luck is to move the Ganesha idol back to the family temple. Gomathi, who has a blind belief in such matters, agrees to do it in no time. When Gomathi informs Ravi about these new turns of events, Ravi's dreams surrounding the idol get shattered. Ravi steals the Ganesha idol from his mother's bedroom on that rainy night. He hides it in his cousin's old car lying unwanted outside their house for ages.

Ravi tries to contact Parvatham to sell the stolen idol, but he can't reach her. Since he has no information about her whereabouts, Ravi falls into total crisis. In that desperation, Ravi contacts Charles, a pickpocket from the Vaathuruthi colony, whom he met at the police station a few days ago. After listening to Ravi's problems, Charles unconditionally agrees to help him out. So Ravi and Charles venture out to find an appropriate place to sell the idol. They go to many shops and centres of Kochi where such fraudulent activities take place. This journey develops a deep friendship between them.

Charles' company reinstates Ravi's lost confidence and positivity. After passing through many struggles and days of tense moments, Charles and Ravi finally sell the idol, which also brings Gomathi's ideas about God to new heights. With the money he earns from the Ganesha idol, Ravi starts a shop selling idols. He names it after his pickpocket buddy- Charles Enterprises!</div>"

The brothers are provided shelter and food by a local elderly woman (Paravai Muniyamma) whom Raja affectionately calls as paati. She has a granddaughter Lakshmi (Neelima Rani), whom Raja considers as his own sister. Now Raja in his adulthood makes ends meet as a bus driver, while his three brothers become doctor, policeman and lawyer as per his father's wish. One day, his sister shows disinterest in going to college and complains about eve-teasing. Raja dismisses the claim and asks her to attend. She convinces him to come with her. On seeing her a group of college men start ogling her. Raja walks up to them, and suggests them toogle at voluptuous women like Nayanthara and leave not so good looking girls like his sister alone. The youths ignoring his words, remarks that Raja's sister indeed has a curvy Hourglass figure and proceeds to molest her. Enraged by this Raja fights and chases them away warning others to stay away from his sister. Raja is then kidnapped by Thangapazham (Meenakshi) while he is asleep by a group of woman she controls. She expresses her lust over Raja and pronounces that she will get him to do what she says. Raja escapes from her while she's distracted. Thangapazham is then kidnapped by Krishnamoorthy (Karunas) who inturn expresses his lust over thangapazham which she blatantly ignores. Meanwhile Shailja (Mumtaj), a woman gangster turned politician who openly admits to having slept her way to become a minister, is seen beating up a cop for not falling on her feet.

He pushes some of them towards her and takes few pictures while they fall on her. Later, Raja is once again kidnapped by Thangapazham, this time wearing slinky clothes to arouse Raja. She proceeds to threaten Raja and forces him to measure her body with a tape. He reluctantly measure her waist and hips.

However turning greedy he demands money and gets into a fight with Paati. He then brutally murders the sister out of rage and the old woman to eliminate a possible eyewitness. It is revealed that all three brothers are corrupt and accomplices of Shailaja. After learning this, Raja swears an oath to eliminate the three brothers by betraying them while acting to be on their side. When spying on his brothers he meets with Nikhita (Snigdha Akolkar), a girl who admires Raja for his character. It is revealed that she is the sister of the dreaded Shailaja.

At night, when the police officer pairs up with a high-class prostitute Babilona for sex in his police vehicle, Raja ties the vehicle and traps them inside using a crane. He gets caught red-handed the next morning and is suspended from office. The three brothers initially suspect Raja, but he manipulates them into believing that he's innocent. The doctor brother is a pervert who keeps camera inside the nurses' dressing room and watches while they change dress. Watching one such nurse remove her dress, he's called for work. Using this opportunity Raja enters and breaks the camera, stealing the doctor's laptop for evidence. He beats the doctor viciously. Later knowing about her sister and his friendship, Shailaja orders her goons to beat up Raja. He beats them and shows that he is unbeatable. He then proceeds to slap Shailaja in her butt, mocking her in the process. He then asks Nikita to slap her sister Shailaja using her footwear, in order for him to love her, which she happily does. During an award ceremony for his doctor brother, Raja blackmails using the previous evidences he gathered, forcing him to agree and announce infront of the crowd that he will perform 100 heart surgeries for free. Shailaja later enters the brothers home for a meet. Fearing recognition Raja masks his face with cream and mimicks a feminine voice. Failing to recognise him, she has a quick convo with Raja. Raja then asks Shailaja to adjust her sari, mocking that she is exposing her assets. During a visit to a temple, Shailaja is in her caravan travelling. The caravan is abducted and taken control by Raja and Krishna Murthy. He then remarks that his lover, Shailaja's sister is a little thin while Shailaja on the other hand is a buxom woman, who is naturally arousing to men.

In a flashback, the young man Surya was a blue-collar worker in a metal workshop. His parents (K. K. P. Gopalakrishnan and Vasanthi) wanted him to get married, but Surya was quite shy by nature, had low self-esteem, and his only social life was when he met his five friends who were unlike him. Anbu (Benito Franklin), who owned a photo studio, was a married man and a womanizer. Velliangiri (Vetrivel) was a carefree young man working in a cotton factory. Varathan (Madhankumar) was a loan lender who liked watching adult films and spending time with prostitutes. Govindan (Govindan) was a middle-aged man who was an ardent fan of Kamal Haasan and desperately wanted to get married. Shanmugam (Shanmugam) was a wastrel who tried to woo a village girl. Anbu advised Surya to follow his methods of wooing, but it failed miserably. Surya then watched adult films in a cinema theatre and went to a brothel as Varathan did, but when a prostitute touched his hand, Surya ran away from the place. Surya's parents then found him a girl: Jothi, a beautiful young woman who studied computer science. However, Jothi did not want to marry Surya: she found him not-good-looking and not educated enough; above all else, she was afraid of him. Surya then tried to change his looks and behavior. The two eventually got engaged with the blessings of their family. Later, Surya, who became an overprotective fiancé, suspected her college mate Kishore (J. Durairaj) of wooing Jothi and beat him up. Surya then tried to keep Anbu from his fiancé, and one day revealed Anbu's seduction activities to his family, and the two got into a fight. Surya even suspected her uncle (Kovai Madhan) from Dubai of wooing Jothi. In the meantime, Jothi started to like Surya for being caring and protective. The day before the wedding, a tensed Surya beat up Jothi's uncle; thus, the wedding was cancelled and her father Chellamuthu (Chellamuthu) wanted Jothi to marry her uncle. Surya and his family returned home. A saddened Surya drank poison. Shortly after, he came to know that his wedding was not cancelled and then fainted. Surya was rushed to the hospital and died in the hospital bed. Back to the present, Surya's body is buried in a cemetery and it was his spirit who narrated the flashback, while Jothi mourns the loss of her fiancé at his grave.</div>"

Malar's marriage to Ranjan, a journalist only lasted three days when unknown men abducted him. He joined the ever-growing list of missing persons who voiced for human rights in the country. In fear of their own lives, Malar and family move to Canada and settle in the suburbs of Toronto. The conventional Tamil family values continued and Malar's brother, Jeeva freely went to school, got a degree, found a job in Toronto, and chose to marry the girl he loved. In contrary, Malar was expected to wait for her disappeared husband under the wings of her parents and brother. Two decades pass slowly and Malar lives as a shadow in her own house without a voice of her own. She adores plants and nature and her only happiness in the life is gardening and walks in the park. In search of her missing husband, her mother seeks out for astrologists to predict Malar's future and her husband's possible return while her father exhausts his attempts to contact the local and international human rights organisations.

As Ravi grows, Prabha does not like this and forbids Sulochana from raising Ravi.

Ravi falls ill due to the separation and Sulochana takes care of him day and night not bothering her meals and health. Ravi becomes very serious for a month till the doctor who treats him lose hope. Sulochana takes Ravi to a temple and pleads to Lord Shiva to take her life instead and spare Ravi's life.

After thanking Karunakaran and Vasudevan for a good life as a daughter-in-law in the house and says that she would be reborn in this house, Sulochana dies.

Sulochana's body was cremated but Karunakaran and Vasudevan were surprised to see the gold bangles were not damaged during the process. A baby girl was born on the exact day after a year and she was accepted by the whole family as Sulochana reborn.

Dancer Sulochana and Lakshmiammal have baby girls at the same time in the same hospital.

Sivalingam is not in town at the time of the delivery and his close friend Ramaswamy (V. K. Ramasamy) takes care of Lakshmiammal. When the babies are taken for cleaning by the nurses, there is a short circuit and both nurses die. There is no way of identifying the babies. Sulochana who was abandoned by her husband, leaves the hospital. The doctor (Thambaram Lalitha) brings both babies to Lakshmiammal and she is not able to identify her baby either.

Sivalingam arrives and seeing both babies in the room assumes he has twins. Knowing how important the family line is to him, Lakshmiammal, Ramaswamy and the doctor don't tell him the truth. Both girls, Chandra (Vijayakumari) and Kantha (Pushpalatha) grow up as the zamindar's daughters. Sulochana's brother, Nadaraj (M. R. Radha), who comes to know that his niece is growing up in Sivalingam's household and faced with the same confusion, takes up Lakshmiammal's offer and stays on there as a caretaker. Meanwhile, Lakshmiammal and Ramaswamy's wife, Parvathi (Radha Bhai), who are childhood friends promise to get their children married to each other.

Chandra has a birthmark which is said to be very lucky but is by nature more like her Lakshmiammal. Kantha is more like Sivalingam. Chandra falls in love with her classmate Shekar (R. Muthuraman). Since he is the son of his wealthy friend, the late Mohanasundaram, Sivalingam agrees to the wedding.

Ramaswamy, who lives lavishly and who is careless is his business matters, faces severe business losses and approaches Sivalingam for to back him in business matters. Sivalingam promises to give him money but refuses to let him use his name or claim his acquaintance. He also gives a job to Sundaram (A. V. M. Rajan) in one of his factories but refuses to have any further contacts with their family.

When Ramaswamy and Parvathi hear that Chandra's engagement is fixed, they attend the function uninvited. Sivalingam insults them and Ramaswamy is driven to reveal that one of his daughters is not his own. The doctor mwho was also preseent there needs to confide too. The engagement is stopped and the family is thrown into confusion. Due to this, Shekar's mother (Rukmani) forces him to leave the place.

Sivalingam refuses to talk to his family or the children and becomes extremely disturbed. Chandra tries to find a solution to this problem by leaving the house. She gives a lady called Maragatham her ring to act as the dancer Sulochana. Maragatham goes to Sivalingam's house and says that her daughter can be identified by means of a birthmark.

The police arrive with some jewels and a suicide note from Chandra and they realise that she is now dead. Sivalingam is very happy when he finally becomes convinced that Kantha is his real daughter and fixes her marriage with Shekar. Lakshmiammal is very disturbed because she believes that all the confusion in the house was caused because they did not keep their word to Ramaswamy and Parvathi and get one of the daughters married to Sundaram.

Kantha wants to humiliate Sivalingam, whose conceit caused Chandra's death and she made Lakshiammal practically bedridden. She refuses to marry Shekar and says that she will marry Sundaram. Meanwhile, Nadaraj who was thrown out of the house by Sivalingam traces Maragatham through the ring that she tried to pawn and the family is again thrown into confusion.

Meanwhile, Chandra who attempts suicide by jumping into a river is saved by the inmates of an ashram. They persuade her to stay on as a teacher to the orphan students and she agrees. Shekar who is now an Education Inspector comes to the school and sees her. The principal (S. R. Janaki) however convinces him that she is an orphan girl who always lived in the ashram.

Shekar then narrates the story of Chandra and also tell the principal that her sacrifice was wasted because Maragatham confessed the truth. He also tells her that both Sivalingam and Lakshmi are bedridden and that Kantha is struggling to care for both parents. Chandra wants to go back home but makes up her mind to move away instead. She requests for a transfer. Nadaraj overhears the principal and Chandra talking and is realises that Chandra is alive. He tells Sivalingam and Lakshmiammal and they set out in search of her.

Chandra's taxi hits Sivalingam and he is admitted in the hospital. Both daughters give him blood and he understands that character is more important than family. Chandra marries Shekar and Kantha marries Sundaram.</div>"

The local villagers fear Jameen Kottai and the guards that protect it. Many believe that a secret treasure is hidden in the palace. One day, Ra Sankaran and his daughter, Mohini, arrive at the palace where she has a vision of a past life. Meanwhile, an elderly lady secretly records the conversation of a group plotting to retrieve the treasure. The lather gives the recording to Manickam, who finds a clue relating to the location of the treasure, which then leads him to Karuvapatti. Manickam and his friend Prakash decide to buy the land in order to start searching for the treasure before others do. They are small-time crooks who want the treasure at any cost. They plow the land and uncover a large object carved with hideous figures.

Madasamy is a skilled locksmith who lives with his sister Rajeshwari. He discovers that the village's doctor, Vasanth, is secretly in love with his sister, and he decides to arrange their marriage. The doctor's family asks for a huge dowry for his sister, which Madasamy accepts. He then decides to find work in the city hoping to earn a greater salary. As Madasamy is leaving the village, he meets Prakash and Manickam who ask him for a favor. They offer him money to accompany them to the palace.

The three visit the palace that same night, and Madasamy manages to open its main safe. Prakash and Manickam give him enough money to fund his sister's wedding and Madasamy leaves. In the safe, a manuscript explains how to obtain the treasure. A few days later, on the night of the full moon, Prakash and Manickam return to the palace. There, Prakash beats up Manickam with the intention of keeping the treasure for himself. Alone, Prakash conducts the ritual as described in the manuscript. However, to his astonishment, he summons a satanic spirit that ends up killing him. The spirit flees the palace and encounters Rajeshwari, ""possessing"" his body.

Meanwhile, Madasamy arranges his sister's wedding and goes to Chennai to consult an astrologer. The astrologer says his sister's marriage will happen successfully, but Ra Sankaran says it will not.

Mathi is a TV producer, who works in a private television channel that does small scale shows like cookery. He is a happy go lucky person, whose life revolves around his job, parents and friends. Life takes him into a new course when he meets Thirupurasundhari (Thirupu) - a girl he rescues from a road accident.

Love engulfs him and grows stronger after he realizes that she has a helping heart and is quite concerned about people and the society. One day, Mathi and Thirupu happen to see a woman being teased in public. On noticing Mathi giving a deaf ear to what had happened, Thirupu gets upset and explains to him the importance of a common man standing against social nuisances like this.

Mathi takes the advice seriously and goes on to do a TV show that highlights the injustices that happen in the society. The TV show gains popularity - but one fine day, Mathi's maid's eight year old daughter is kidnapped. Mathi files a complaint at the police station and during the investigation of the case, the police manage to nab a team that happens to have the kid and a few other girls in an unconscious state in their vehicle.

The inspector asks Mathi to go to the hospital, where the girls have been admitted. When Mathi signs formality documents to take the child home, he notices that all the girls, who have been kidnapped are of the same age of his maid's daughter, but appear grown up.

Smelling noxiousness in the whole thing, Mathi meets the doctor to clarify the whole thing. The doctor does a few tests with the blood samples of the other girls and finds out that they were not only drugged, but also injected with a growth hormone called oxytocin - a chemical used in broiler chickens and vegetables for fast growth.

The chemical was injected into the girls for them to arrive at early puberty so that they could be sold into prostitution. Mathi is alarmed by the whole finding and informs the police about the same. However, the inspector, this time round, tells Mathi harshly, not to poke his nose into their job.

That evening, Mathi gets a call from an unknown number. The voice in the call, threatens him and warns him not to dig deeper into his new findings. Mathi goes to the police station again, only to be diverted to the CBCID office as the sub inspector says the CBCID has taken over the case.

At the CBCID office, the chief officer Chandramouli takes up all the evidences and begin to track the racket down with the help of Mathi. A lot of investigation gets the racket exposed and the CBCID team rescue all the kidnapped girls in an encounter.

This narrows down their search to Inba, the leader of the gang. Inba gets to know of Mathi's participation in the whole encounter and takes revenge by killing his father. How Mathi reciprocates to Inba's revenge and what he does to Inba forms the rest of the story.</div>"

Chandrasekharan had a marriage arranged with Chithra (Indhu), who was more educated than him, and she later gave birth to Lakshmi (Baby Subhashree).

One day, her childhood friend Amit (Ravi Rahul) met her and got closer to her. They even had an affair. When Chandrasekharan comes to know about their affair, he forcefully took his wife's thaali around her neck and kicked her out of his house.

On his Vignesh's fourth birthday the Doctor was late for the celebration; but he gives Vignesh a trumpet which he likes very much. The same night while they were celebrating, a Kabooli (Manivannan) comes with a child who was suffering from fever to the doctor. The doctor doesn't treat the child and ask him to take the child to hospital. A call comes at midnight saying that the Kabooli's son is serious. The doctor rushes to the hospital and he takes his son with him. Vignesh is very much attached to the music played by the Kabooli. Kabooli's son Madhavan dies in the hospital and he runs away from the hospital with Vignesh. After 15 years the story shifts to Chennai, where we see Kannas (Thangaraj) and Kadalas (Ilavarasu) who are street boys. They stay with Amminiamma (Sabitha Anand) and they are in love with her daughters. One of her daughters steals some valuables from the house where she does household work. In order to save them, Kannas and Kadalas go to prison. When they return, they find both are married and move out of the house with sorrow. Madhavan (Ramana) comes in search of Kannas and Kadalas because they went to prison for stealing the trumpet which was at stake. Kannas and Kadalas have buried the trumpet in the ground and now there is a circus tent around it. While trying to take it out; the trumpet is taken by Rani (Kutti Radhika) the daughter of the circus owner. Madhavan asks for the trumpet and she refuses to give it. They fight with each other and in the process Madhavan tries to prove that Rani has an illicit relation with him. Her father Meesaikarar (Anandraj) is furious and he tries to kill Madhavan. But before that Madhavan tells him that he did all this for his trumpet and he has no relation with his daughter. Meesaikarar asks Rani to return the trumpet. Madhavan plays the same music which the Kabooli used to play. All in the circus tent are shocked to hear it and it is revealed that Madhavan is Meesaikarar's nephew. All in the circus tent accept him wholeheartedly. Madhavan ignores Rani and she tries to commit suicide. Madhavan confesses his love for her. While romancing he plays the same music and the doctor who was passing by hears it and he comes with his daughters and sons-in-law and they forcefully take him. Madhavan tries to leave but is given sedation. One of the sons-in-law is a police officer and the other is a doctor and they are able to arrest Meesaikarar who comes to release Madhavan. The doctor shows the photograph of dead Madhavan and the newspaper articles reporting the kidnap of Vignesh to the people in the circus tent. Meesaikarar is released under the condition that they would leave the city within 48 hours. Meesaikarar is also furious and says that he will marry off his daughter within 48 hours and his son would curse him for being his father. Kannas and Kadalas come to Madhavan's house and she stops them. She requests Kannas and Kadalas not to take her son back to the streets. Kannas and Kadalas reveal the love between Madhavan and Rani and also tell her that Madhavan would be happy only with Rani. The doctor also decides to leave the city the next morning. Madhavan sees the door of his bedroom opened. He is successful in getting out of the house through the back door, but is shocked to see her there. She tells him that she was the one who opened all doors for him because she couldn't see him sad. She asks him to run with his Rani. The mother blesses her son and he leaves. But when he reaches the circus tent he is badly beaten up by Meesaikarar and party. Rani is not allowed to leave. Kannas and Kadalas take Madhavan from there and they help Rani run away with Madhavan. But Meesaikarar finds them. He tries to kill Madhavan, but can't.

Many years later, Babu reappeared as a melancholic man who lost all his wealth and asked Father James for forgiveness. Mary had a boy called Alex (Master Nadim Khan). Alex forced his mother Mary to live with Babu who had not changed at all. Babu's behaviors became worse : he behaved badly with the school teacher Poornitha (Raksha) in public, he spent time with a prostitute (Shakeela), he even tried to seduce Lakshmi (Kavitha) who resurfaced to see her daughter Mary, he drank a lot of alcohols in a bar owned by (Alex) and worst that he molested his wife and beat up his son.

To care of Mokkasamy, Periyamaayan decided to re-marry to a much younger woman but she then ill-treated Mokkasamy and disallowed intimacy with Periyamaayan. When Periyamaayan came to know about his second wife's extramarital affair with a stranger, Periyamaayan killed them both and was jailed, leaving his son alone. Therefore, Mokkasamy was struggling with no money and he did odd jobs. Karutha Pandi (Thiravi Pandian), a local rowdy with a golden heart, took Mokkasamy under his wing and considered Mokkasamy like his own son. Many years later, after coming out of jail, Periyamaayan returns to his village and he is astonished to see his son Mokkasamy being arrested by the police. A constable told about his wife's illicit affair with Nagarasu to Mokkasamy thus an infuriated Mokkasamy killed Nagarasu. Karutha Pandi then bails Mokkasamy out of jail.

Its hard hitting message screams at you from the screen, loud and clear. Hitherto, there seemed to be only a couple of angles to Child labour in India, viz., children losing out on their carefree childhood and basic formal education. But there are so many other unthought of issues too, says scriptwriter and director Poomani, through the film Karuvelam Pookkal, jointly produced by NFDC and Doordarshan. Karisalkulam, a small village, is inhabited mainly by Farmers. When the arid land offers them nothing but penury, enter the match factory owners from nearby villages. They lure the credulous, illiterate villagers into sending their daughters to work at the factories from dawn to much after dusk. The initial euphoria of a steady income givesway to despair, as is clearly brought out through the story of Nallamuthu (Nasser), his wife Vadivu (Radhika) and their three children. Mariyappan (Charle) is the Match factory agent in charge of finding child labourers for the factory. While the children slog in the factories the men of the household become lazy appendages who spend their time getting drunk. Nasser, as the cynical father, who does not wish to get his daughter married because he does not want to forgo the income, has rendered a splendid performance in Karuvelam Pookal. Mention must be made of the scenes in which he cries aloud at his tragedies and when his impotent anger is turned towards the agents of the match factories. Radhika's is another sterling portrayal. In the role of a responsible mother caught between her husband's apathy and avarice and her children's untold suffering, she indeed lives the character. Sonia is the eldest daughter, Dhanalakshmi. Caught in the quagmire of drudgery and in the strangulating web of poverty, she seeks a way out, but sadly the respite is too short lived. A convincing essay by the young Actress. The visuals of the opening sequences transport you to the days of Bharatiraja's movie 16 Vayadhinilae. The beautifully captured rustic ambience is another creditable show by Thangar Bachan who has wielded the camera. The dialect, the innocent humour, the openness and the gullibility - Poomani presents them all with absolute vividness. The factories need only young girls and the boys therefore escape the hardship. After stressing on this point throughout, it is strange to see the boy accompany his sister to work, in the end. The fragrance of Karuvelam Pookkal is bound to last in the minds of the discerning audience. A film that makes you think.</div>"

The girls who all had a rough start living on the streets, where they faced abuse and violence on a daily basis, are an inspiration to everyone who meets them because of their positive and uplifting spirit. They see the event as an opportunity to share to the world their plight. They hope to become a role model for other street children and show that street children are somebody.

The United Nations estimates there are up to 150 million children surviving on the streets worldwide. Life on the streets for these children is filled with danger. Instead of receiving support, they are often blamed for their situation and stigmatized. As a result, they face violence and abuse. Although they are vulnerable, they are also resourceful and resilient - but are denied the opportunities they need to realize their potential.

The Street Child World Cup 2018 in Moscow brought together more than 200 street-connected children from across the world for their own boys and girls international football tournaments, festival of arts and congress for their rights. The Street Child World Cup uses the power of football to raise awareness and tackle the widespread stigma faced by street-connected children, inspiring countries, governments and communities to better protect, respect and support street-connected children worldwide.</div>"

Nandhini Velu Nachiyar (Srushti Dange), Reshmi Kaur (Amrita Chhabria), Mahesh Muthusamy (Nadhim Khan), Mohammed Aslam (Roshan Nawaz), and Angelina Kristy (Nakshatra) were visual communication students and best friends. After the graduation, they had to split up and to go in different directions. Then they met the magician Thyagu (Krishnakumar Balasubramanian), and everything changed. Thyagu and Nandhini were childhood friends and were in love with each other. However, both were from different castes. Nandhini's brother-in-law Raja Rajasekharan (Vijay Gopal) was a despicable caste fanatic and an influential person. He had hatred towards every caste other than his and wanted his community people to get a high post in the society. Thereafter, the six friends formed a group named ""Mantra"", performing dance, magic, or songs for advertisement companies. When Raja was made aware of Nandhini's love, he killed her and swept this issue under the rug. The five friends protested to grant justice for Nandhini's death, but the police force stopped the protest and beat up the friends. The five then started a TV show in which they exposed the truth behind Nandhini's death. When the four friends reach their destination, AK is shocked to see Thyagu and Nandhini together. He later reveals that he is actually a CBI officer who was in charge of Raja's case and then forces the friends to tell him what happened. The friends reveal that Nandhini's death was a sham and they used a fake body to make it look like Nandhini. Also, Raja committed suicide when the police tried to arrest him for a murder he did not commit. While AK is initially unhappy at first, he praises the youngsters for their braveness and hushes up the case, revealing his real name as Ananthakrishnan. He then departs as the six friends rejoice in happiness.</div>"

In order to create his own fortune, Gautham is in search of a job, however, this is an impossible task, since his medical report states that he is a paranoid patient. 

On the verge of being completely rejected by society, Gautham accidently meets Avinash Kumaran (Diluckshan Jeyaratnam), a psychology graduate student. Avinash realises the fact that Gautham is mentally ill, which gives him the idea of writing his masters thesis based on Gautham and his disease. In order to shadow Gautham thoroughly, Avinash turns to his friend Venkatesh Sivakumar aka. Venkat (Geethendra Sugendra), the CEO of the newly founded company InnoTech. Together, they both offer Gautham a job at InnoTech for a trial period of one month, in which Avinash is to thoroughly note Gauthams behavior and reactions in certain conditions.

In spite of finally getting a job, Gautham has not fulfilled his purpose yet. He is still searching for the significant values in life. His greatest wish is to obtain a caring relationship, which he never had, with his sister, Soumya (Stefeja Vasantharasan). Whether he gets to live life, as he wishes it, and thereby fulfills his purpose forms the crux of the story.

Paranoid Patient is a film, which deals with a man who is in search of compassion, friendship and love.

After the murders of Arunachalam (Devan) and Panneerselvam (Sethu Vinayagam), the two influential persons who were mentioned in the diary, the police decides to conduct its investigation with the help of Jeeva and Siva. Jeeva writes a press article about the three rowdies with their photos and concludes that the rowdies killed the two influential persons. The three rowdies then call her to threaten her but she refuses to remove the press article. Later, rowdies kidnap Jeeva and sequester her, an auto-driver saves her and admits her in the nearby hospital. Arrested by the police, the three rowdies reveal that they chased the disfigured man thinking that the suitcase was containing money but the man named Cutting Bhaskar, also a rowdy, told them that there was no money in the suitcase so in anger, they brutally kill him and ran away. Siva finds a similarity between the two murders: five minutes before they were killed, the victims get a call from the same phone number. The police track down the home address of the owner of the phone number and discovers a dead body at that address. Siva later reveals that the auto driver was, in fact, his senior Suman (Suman) and secretly works in this case. Chinrasu is found dead with bullet wounds. Siva finally finds the fourth victim's home address but when the police arrive at the place, Thirunavukkarasu (Azhagu) is found dead. The police then arrest the two suspects: Veera (Chandrahassan Jayaprakash) and Ravi (Vaiyapuri) who murdered the four persons. The two become mentally handicapped persons after an incident that upended their lives. Veera was a teenager who lived with his parents and beloved sister. His father deposited all his savings in a chit fund company for his daughter's marriage but one day, the chit fund company employees swindled their money and escaped. Thereafter, Veera's family committed suicide. Ravi was also a victim of this scam. Together, they decided to kill the four employees of that fake chit fund company. In view of their mental health, the court judge sends them to a mental asylum.</div>"

One day, Raghava, the brother of the local don Kottai Kumaraswamy (Muthuswamy), and his friends eve-teased and molested Jaya in a shop.

They beg Thamizharasan to fight against social evils like corruption and rowdyism and they ask him to abolish bail. The public strongly supports the students and their request. Thamizharasan also decides to support the students, he asks them to release the hostages and promises to clear them. When Thamizharasan went to see the governor, his car exploded and on the news, Thamizharasan is pronounced dead. At the headquarters of Thamizharasan's party, the politicians have a savage fight on who will be the next leader of the party and the governor dismisses the current government. A few months later, Thamizharasan returns alive just before the election. Thamizharasan tells the media that he was saved by the students that day and they were protecting him from the people who tried to kill him. With the support of the students, Thamizharasan is reelected as chief minister and he finally abolishes bail.</div>"
